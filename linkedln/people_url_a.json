The situation there was dire. Circumstances forced me to raise my younger sister when I was just nine years old. I wanted to change the narrative of kids growing up in communities like mine. I want to fix poverty, and for good this time.\n\nThrough hard work and determination, I landed a full scholarship to Augustana College, in America. Coming to the United States and studying computer science gave me the platform to accelerate my impact. As an undergrad, I invested all of my income from various campus jobs into my community back in Kenya. I built a school, Zawadi, there and later started TechLit Africa.\n\nTechLit Africa is a non-profit American organization that redistributes recycled technology to build computer labs in African schools. We have already built 10 computers in rural Kenya and are currently working on our next 100 computer labs. We already have around 4,000 students and 20 teachers. By next year we will have around 40,000 students and 200 teachers.\n\nOur program is unique because we teach classes that are relevant; we hire local teachers to make sure of it. We train our own teachers to run the computer labs in their own community, who meet every day to improve their classes. We are unlocking a world of opportunities to these kids. They will be inspired to take on a dozen careers: they will have the skills to tap into the global economy straight from the village.\n\nThis is my life's work because I know first hand how awful poverty is. We plan to do this for the whole of rural Africa, positioning ourselves to 10x our growth year after year.

I enjoyed partnering with my colleagues, our customers, and what eventually became 900M+ members to help make this vision a reality. Along the way, we grew LinkedIn >100X from a pre-IPO, ~$100M revenue company to north of $10B, all while building global leadership positions in recruiting, marketing, sales, and learning on top of the world's largest professional network. \n\nIn the past, I grew up in London and then fell in love with Silicon Valley & the Bay Area starting at Stanford in 1995. I spent time in sports business (2000-04) and management consulting at Bain (2004-10) before joining LinkedIn in roles across sales & go-to-market strategy, analytics & insights, marketing, and product management. I know enough to be dangerous across a variety of functions and roles, a generalist who really likes business more broadly vs. a specialist in any particular area.  \n\nAt work, I'm impatient to make an impact and have a Nike-inspired JFDI screensaver because Nike has been my favourite company since I was 10-years-old and to remind me that actions often speak louder than words.\n\nOutside of work, I'm a long-term elite endurance athlete (college rowing, Ironman triathlon, bike racing, marathon running, currently marathon swimming), happy husband, doting dad, (Taylor) Swiftie, and compulsive reader and film-goer (here's a public spreadsheet with ALL my books & films ever consumed: bit.ly/z2D1sX)\n\nI sporadically publish a \"What's the So What?\" newsletter distilling favourite books and

For the first years I applied my skills to Microsoft’s internal IT systems and human resources structure but in the past 21 years I have found it especially exciting, applying those early business, technical and organizational learnings to a different set of problems.\n\nI have a well-developed skill for understanding even the most complex technical and business concepts and translating them into strategies and tangible action plans that deliver results.  For twelve years I was Chief of Staff for Microsoft’s Chief Research and Strategy Officer. I was involved in advanced strategies resulting in new business startups, and incubations, such as Microsoft’s long term quantum computing effort which required the development and management of a complex business framework, international talent and facilities. I then worked for the Chief Research Officer who was leading innovative work in many areas, such as Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Cognitive Services (vision, speech, language, decision making) and Azure cloud applications.  Most recently, I have managed and developed worldwide strategic partnerships with academia, governments, and industry to grow Microsoft’s advanced high performance and quantum computing business opportunities.\n\nIn my roles, I have typically attended important meetings, even the most confidential, and acted as a “consigliore” with the well understood authority to act on executive’s behalf.  This was sometimes as simple as setting up a specific task team and following through on the associated deliverables, to driving things from strategy to execution.  Sometimes it involved complex opportunities with governments or partners aligned in achieving an important long term technical or business goal, such as establishing technology policy and regulatory frameworks or joint R&D programs. \n\nMy skills in understanding complex technologies and translating thought into concrete actions are essential in a range of areas from providing support to a startup or to established companies with new technologies in accelerating the movement from strategy to action.", "experiences": [{"postion": "Board Observer and Founding Member", "company": "神州网信技术有限公司", "company_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/13240039/", "time": "Sep 2016 - Oct 2018 · 2 yrs 2 mos"}], "education": [{"major": "Ross School of Business - Human Resources Executive Program", "studied_at": "University of Michigan", "school_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/2516/", "time": null}, {"major": "Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Psychology and English Writing ", "studied_at": "University of Puget Sound", "school_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/16898/", "time": null}], "volunteering": [{"role": "Board of Directors", "association": "The Bush School", "associated_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/77735/", "time": "Jan 1992 - Jan 2002 · 10 yrs"}, {"role": "Board of directors", "association": "PONCHO", "associated_url": null, "time": "Jan 1990 - Jan 2007 · 17 yrs"}, {"role": "Board of Directors", "association": "KCTS 9", "associated_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/34987/", "time": "Sep 1998 - Sep 2003 · 5 yrs 1 mo"}, {"role": "Board Member", "association": "ArtsFund", "associated_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/98109/", "time": "Jan 2004 - Jan 2014 · 10 yrs"}], "languages": [], "skills": [{"skill": "Management", "endorsements": "39"}, {"skill": "Strategy", "endorsements": "34"}, {"skill": "Leadership", "endorsements": "16"}, {"skill": "Strategic Planning", "endorsements": "14"}, {"skill": "Cross-functional Team Leadership", "endorsements": "53"}, {"skill": "Business Development", "endorsements": "45"}, {"skill": "Business Strategy", "endorsements": "34"}, {"skill": "Executive Leadership", "endorsements": "1"}, {"skill": "Government Relations", "endorsements": "1"}, {"skill": "Strategic Management", "endorsements": "1"}, {"skill": "Strategic Partnerships", "endorsements": "10"}, {"skill": "Program Management", "endorsements": "25"}, {"skill": "Start-ups", "endorsements": "14"}, {"skill": "Project Management", "endorsements": "13"}, {"skill": "International Business", "endorsements": "11"}, {"skill": "Training", "endorsements": "10"}, {"skill": "Strategic Communications", "endorsements": "8"}, {"skill": "Business Planning", "endorsements": "7"}, {"skill": "Marketing", "endorsements": "7"}, {"skill": "Social Media", "endorsements": "6"}, {"skill": "Cloud Computing", "endorsements": "5"}, {"skill": "Software Development", "endorsements": "5"}, {"skill": "Entrepreneurship", "endorsements": "5"}, {"skill": "Strategic HR", "endorsements": "4"}, {"skill": "Enterprise Software", "endorsements": "6"}, {"skill": "C#", "endorsements": "3"}, {"skill": "Cross-functional Team Leadership", "endorsements": "53"}, {"skill": "Business Development", "endorsements": "45"}, {"skill": "Business Strategy", "endorsements": "34"}, {"skill": "Management", "endorsements": "39"}, {"skill": "Executive Leadership", "endorsements": "1"}, {"skill": "Government Relations", "endorsements": "1"}, {"skill": "Strategic Management", "endorsements": "1"}, {"skill": "Strategic Partnerships", "endorsements": "10"}, {"skill": "Strategy", "endorsements": "34"}, {"skill": "Program Management", "endorsements": "25"}, {"skill": "Leadership", "endorsements": "16"}, {"skill": "Start-ups", "endorsements": "14"}, {"skill": "Strategic Planning", "endorsements": "14"}, {"skill": "Project Management", "endorsements": "13"}, {"skill": "International Business", "endorsements": "11"}, {"skill": "Training", "endorsements": "10"}, {"skill": "Strategic Communications", "endorsements": "8"}, {"skill": "Business Planning", "endorsements": "7"}, {"skill": "Marketing", "endorsements": "7"}, {"skill": "Social Media", "endorsements": "6"}, {"skill": "World Traveler", "endorsements": "2"}], "organizations": [], "honors": [{"name": "Microsoft High-Potential Bench Program", "issued_by": null}, {"name": "Multiple Microsoft Gold Star Awards for Leadership Excellence and Impact", "issued_by": null}], "certifications": []},
